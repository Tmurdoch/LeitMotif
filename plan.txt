Requirements:

recognizes something is playing, either through microphone, or an integrated spotify web api
	

format for audio files

read and play audio files

function that transposes audio to correct key

function that asseses the current key of song playing, or finds out somehow what the key is (web scrape?)

function that finds time signature

interface to play any leitmotif in loaded into program
	must also make sure leitmotif is in time signature



extra features:

program that finds time signature





plan:

look into spotipy: might be helpful

make some stubs / mocks for Web API

figure out how to authorize spotify, or get authorization so can access account details
(specifically what song is playing)
	need website
	need return URL
	step 1: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/
	step 2: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-the-users-currently-playing-track/

once the program knows what song it is use a website like tunebat.com to figure out key

transpose leitmotifs to key of song

match leitmotif to BPM

play leitmotif over song at the right time 

profit

implementation:

makefile for keeping things up to date

seperate bash scripts for web functions, pipelined together
bash script that executes whole program
bash script to execute spotify requests
pipe that to
bash script for web scrapes
